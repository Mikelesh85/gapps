<h2>Purpose and Scope</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The purpose of this data classification policy is to establish requirements ensuring the
    safeguarding of information at an appropriate level within the organization.
  </li>
  <li>This policy encompasses the entire spectrum of the organization's information security
    program, encompassing all forms of information regardless of their form, encompassing both
    electronic and physical documents, applications, databases, as well as knowledge and unwritten
    information.
  </li>
  <li>This policy is binding for all individuals and systems with access to the organization's
    information.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Background</h2>
<ul>
  <li>This policy establishes the overarching objectives and procedural guidelines for the
    organization's data classification framework.
  </li>
  <li>This encompasses classification levels, procedures for classification, labeling, and
    management of data. This policy also ensures alignment with confidentiality and non-disclosure
    agreements upheld by the organization.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Policy</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Classification from External Sources</li>
  <li>If classified information is received from external sources, the recipient must classify it
    in adherence with the stipulations outlined in this policy, thereby assuming ownership of the
    information.
  </li>
  <li>Classification from External Sources and Business Activities</li>
  <li>When handling classified information received externally as part of business operations
    (e.g., customer data within cloud services), the classification and ownership must align with
    the respective customer service agreement and legal requirements.
  </li>
  <li>Classification Criteria During classification, the confidentiality level is ascertained based
    on:
  </li>
  <li>Information value, derived from risk assessment impact. For further details on risk
    assessments, refer to the Risk Assessment Policy.
  </li>
  <li>Sensitivity and criticality, considering the highest risk identified during risk
    assessment.
  </li>
  <li>Compliance with legal, regulatory, and contractual obligations.</li>
  <li>Classification Levels and Labeling Information shall be classified based on confidentiality
    levels as per Table 3. Efforts should be made to apply the lowest confidentiality level that
    maintains adequate protection, minimizing unnecessary production costs.
  </li>
  <li>Accompanying Authorized Access Lists "Restricted" or "Confidential" classified information
    must be accompanied by a list specifying authorized individuals, detailing names or job roles
    with access rights. For "Internal Use" classification, an authorized access list is required
    only if external individuals access the document.
  </li>
  <li>Periodic Review</li>
  <li>Information and information system owners shall review the confidentiality level of their
    assets every five years and determine if changes are necessary. Whenever feasible, efforts
    should be made to reduce confidentiality levels.
  </li>

  <li>Cloud-Based Services</li>
  <li>For cloud-based services within the organization's control, system owners must also review
    confidentiality levels after service agreement modifications or formal customer notifications.
    Reduction of confidentiality levels is permissible when consistent with service agreements.
  </li>
  <li>Labeling Procedures Information shall be labeled as follows:</li>
  <li>Paper Documents:</li>
  <li>Indicate confidentiality level at top and bottom of each page and on the cover, envelope,
    and filing folder. Default classification for unlabeled documents is "Internal Use."
  </li>
  <li>Electronic Documents:</li>
  <li>Display confidentiality level at top and bottom of each page. Default classification for
    unlabeled documents is "Internal Use."
  </li>
  <li>Information Systems:</li>
  <li>Indicate confidentiality level on system access screen and display screen.</li>
  <li>Electronic Mail:</li>
  <li>Display confidentiality level in the first line of the email body. Default classification
    for unlabeled emails is "Internal Use."
  </li>
  <li>Electronic Storage Media:</li>
  <li>Display confidentiality level on media surface. Default classification for unlabeled media
    is "Internal Use."
  </li>
  <li>Oral Communication:</li>
  <li>Mention confidentiality level before discussing information.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compliance and Incident Reporting</h2>
<ul>
  <li>All personnel accessing classified information must comply with guidelines in Appendix A,
    "Handling of Classified Information." Incidents involving improper handling must be reported
    according to the Security Incident Management Policy.
  </li>
</ul>
