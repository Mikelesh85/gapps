<h2>Purpose and Scope</h2>
<ul>
<li>This policy outlines the requisite measures for establishing and upholding foundational security standards for company software, network devices, servers, and desktop systems.</li>
<li>It applies to all individuals engaged in software development, system administration, and related activities within the organization, encompassing employees, contractors, and external parties involved in these functions.</li>
<li>This policy is accessible to all users within its scope.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Background</h2>
<ul>
<li>The underlying objective of this policy is to ensure a well-structured, secure, and consistent approach to managing the complete lifecycle of software and information systems.</li>
<li>It covers the entire spectrum, from initial requirements analysis to eventual system decommissioning.</li>
<li>The policy delineates procedures, roles, and responsibilities for each stage of the software development lifecycle.</li>
<li>The software development lifecycle may be executed in various forms, including linear progression or iterative cycles.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Policy</h2>
<ul>
<li>This policy outlines the key principles and actions governing the organization's software development lifecycle:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): The organization's SDLC comprises the following phases:</li>
</ul>
<li>Requirements Analysis</li>
<li>Architecture and Design</li>
<li>Testing</li>
<li>Deployment/Implementation</li>
<li>Operations/Maintenance</li>
<li>Decommission</li>

<ul>
<li>Protection of Non-Production Data:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Throughout SDLC phases excluding production, live data sets containing personally identifiable information, financial data, or sensitive information must not be utilized.</li>
<li>Sensitive information is restricted from use beyond production environments.</li>
</ul>

<li>Requirements Analysis Phase:</li>
<ul>
<li>Analyze business requirements.</li>
<li>Perform risk assessment, guided by the Risk Assessment Policy (reference [a]).</li>
<li>Address security aspects (e.g., confidentiality, integrity, availability) relevant to the requirement.</li>
<li>Review regulatory mandates, organizational policies, standards, procedures, and guidelines.</li>
<li>Consider future business goals and current operational landscape.</li>
<li>Incorporate program management aspects.</li>
<li>Define security solution requirements.</li>
<li>Assess security solution costs and budget constraints.</li>
<li>Approve security requirements and budget.</li>
<li>Make informed decisions on "buy vs. build" for security services.</li>
</ul>

<li>Architecture and Design Phase:</li>
<ul>
<li>Educate development teams on secure system development.</li>
<li>Develop or refine infrastructure security architecture.</li>
<li>Specify technical and non-technical security controls.</li>
<li>Conduct architecture walkthrough.</li>
<li>Create system-level security design.</li>
<li>Formulate high-level technical and non-technical security designs.</li>
<li>Analyze design components through cost-benefit analysis.</li>
<li>Document detailed technical security design.</li>
<li>Perform comprehensive design reviews.</li>
<li>Define security processes, procedures, and segregation of duties.</li>
<li>Establish end-user training and awareness programs.</li>
<li>Formulate a general security test plan.</li>
<li>Update organizational policies, standards, and procedures as required.</li>
<li>Mitigate residual vulnerabilities within application and infrastructure.</li>
</ul>

<li>Development Phase:</li>
<ul>
<li>Configure secure development environment.</li>
<li>Provide training on software installation and configuration for infrastructure teams.</li>
<li>Develop code for application-level security.</li>
<li>Set up and integrate testing infrastructure.</li>
<li>Establish security-related vulnerability tracking processes.</li>
<li>Draft detailed security test plan and execute unit and integration testing.</li>
</ul>

<li>Testing Phase:</li>
<ul>
<li>Review code and configurations through static and dynamic analysis to identify vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Test configuration procedures.</li>
<li>Perform system tests and assess performance under security controls.</li>
<li>Conduct usability testing of application security measures.</li>
<li>Execute independent vulnerability assessments on both infrastructure and application.</li>
</ul>

<li>Deployment Phase:</li>
<ul>
<li>Pilot deployment of infrastructure, application, and related components.</li>
<li>Transition from pilot to full-scale deployment.</li>
<li>Verify file integrity to ensure authenticity.</li>
<li>Conduct training and awareness programs for administrative personnel and users.</li>
<li>Require dual developer participation for production environment deployment.</li>
</ul>

<li>Operations/Maintenance Phase:</li>
<ul>
<li>User and access administration.</li>
<li>Performance tuning.</li>
<li>Scheduled backups in line with System Availability Policy.</li>
<li>Routine system maintenance, including security updates and patches.</li>
<li>Deliver training and awareness initiatives.</li>
<li>Conduct periodic system vulnerability assessments.</li>
<li>Perform annual risk assessments.</li>
<li>Validate operational system security controls and monitor logs.</li>
<li>Implement proactive system and user monitoring.</li>
<li>Execute software and hardware patching within specified timelines.</li>
</ul>

<li>Decommission Phase:</li>
<ul>
<li>Upon decommissioning, these steps are observed:</li>
</ul>
<li>Conduct unit and integration testing following component removal.</li>
<li>Facilitate operational transition for component removal or replacement.</li>
<li>Define data retention requirements for software and system data.</li>
<li>Document detailed technical security design.</li>
<li>Update organizational policies, standards, and procedures as necessary.</li>
<li>Resolve remaining vulnerabilities within the application and infrastructure.</li>
