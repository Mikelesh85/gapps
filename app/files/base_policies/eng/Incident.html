<h2>Purpose and Scope</h2>
<ul>
    <li>This policy establishes a framework for efficient detection, response, and management of security
        vulnerabilities and incidents within the organization.
    </li>
    <li>It encompasses procedures, responsibilities, and performance metrics for incident response.</li>
    <li>The policy applies to all information system users, including employees, contractors, and external parties
        interacting with the organization's systems.
    </li>
    <li>This policy shall be accessible to all users.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Background</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The organization's Information Security Program emphasizes proactive identification of security weaknesses to
        prevent incidents. While efforts are focused on safeguarding against malicious actions, incidents and breaches
        may occur. In such cases, the organization commits to swift response, encompassing identification, containment,
        investigation, resolution, and communication of breach-related details to stakeholders.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Policy</h2>
<ul>
    <li>All users are mandated to promptly report system vulnerabilities, incidents, or potential incidents to the
        Information Security Manager (ISM) within 24 hours.
    </li>
    <li>Incidents should be reported via email to &lt;insert email address here&gt;, providing comprehensive incident
        details.
    </li>
    <li>Users shall receive training on incident reporting procedures and their responsibilities.</li>
    <li>Failure to report incidents will be considered a security violation, warranting reporting to the Human Resources
        (HR) Manager for disciplinary action.
    </li>
    <li>Preservation of information and artifacts related to security incidents is imperative for potential use as
        evidence in legal proceedings.
    </li>
    <li>Incident response shall adhere to defined procedures and guidelines outlined below.</li>
    <li>To ensure preparedness, incident response procedures must undergo an annual review and update, and testing shall
        occur biannually.
    </li>
    <li>Incident response logs shall be assessed monthly to evaluate response effectiveness.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Procedure for Establishing Incident Response System</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Establish an on-call schedule and assign an Information Security Manager (ISM) for each availability window.
    </li>
    <li>Establish a notification channel for alerting on-call ISM of potential security incidents.</li>
    <li>Compile a resource with up-to-date contact information for on-call ISM.</li>
    <li>Assign management sponsors from Engineering, Legal, HR, Marketing, and C-Suite teams.</li>
    <li>Distribute and ensure access to the Procedure for Executing Incident Response among staff.</li>
    <li>Require staff to complete biannual training for executing incident response.</li>
</ul>

<li>Procedure for Executing Incident Response</li>
<ul>
    <li>Upon identification or detection of an information security incident, users shall inform their immediate manager
        within 24 hours. The manager shall then promptly notify the on-call ISM for appropriate action. Notification
        shall encompass the following details:
    </li>
</ul>
<li>Incident description</li>
<li>Incident date, time, and location</li>
<li>Discoverer's identity</li>
<li>Discovery method</li>
<li>Evidentiary details</li>
<li>Affected system(s)</li>

<li>Within 48 hours of the report, the ISM shall conduct a preliminary investigation and risk assessment to validate
    incident details. Upon confirmation, the ISM shall gauge impact, assign a severity level, and determine remediation
    efforts based on severity:
</li>
<ul>
    <li>High: Potentially catastrophic with possible disruption to operations; legal/regulatory breach likely.</li>
    <li>Medium: Harms one or more business units or causes delays.</li>
    <li>Low: Clear policy violation with limited business impact.</li>
</ul>
<li>The ISM, with management sponsors, shall prescribe incident response activities to contain and resolve the
    incident.
</li>
<li>The ISM shall ensure forensic evidence preservation, retaining information such as logs and files for potential
    legal investigations.
</li>
<li>For High or Medium incidents, the ISM, in consultation with the VP Brand/Creative, General Counsel, and HR Manager,
    shall devise and implement a communications plan to notify users, the public, and stakeholders.
</li>
<li>The ISM shall take necessary actions to rectify the incident, documenting technical steps in the incident log:</li>
<ul>
    <li>Incident description</li>
    <li>Severity level</li>
    <li>Root cause</li>
    <li>Evidence</li>
    <li>Mitigations</li>
    <li>Status</li>
    <li>Disclosures</li>

    <li>After resolution, the ISM shall conduct a post-mortem, including root cause analysis and lessons learned
        documentation.
    </li>
    <li>The CEO may engage external authorities depending on incident severity.</li>
    <li>The ISM shall notify users of the incident, conduct further training if needed, and share lessons learned. HR
        Manager shall take action against malicious users, if required.
    </li>
</ul>
