<h2>Purpose and Scope</h2>
<ul>
<li>This policy outlines the objectives, requirements, and guidelines for storing data on removable media, cloud storage, and personally-owned devices, irrespective of data classification level.</li>
<li>The policy extends to all information and data encompassed within the organizationâ€™s information security program, as well as all removable media, cloud systems, and personally-owned devices either owned or controlled by the organization.</li>
<li>Applicability of this policy extends to all users of information systems within the organization, encompassing employees, contractors, and external parties interacting with systems and information under the organization's control.</li>
<li>It is imperative for this policy to be easily accessible to all users.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Background</h2>
<ul>
<li>The purpose of this policy is to establish procedures for secure utilization of removable media, cloud storage, and personally-owned devices to mitigate the risks of data loss or exposure. Due to the potential storage of sensitive data on these mediums, stringent control is essential.</li>
<li>The transient or portable nature of these storage methods demands rigorous adherence to security standards to prevent loss of oversight or control over stored information.</li>
<li>This policy comprises three distinct sections pertaining to removable media, cloud storage, and personally-owned devices. Each section outlines requirements and guidelines for the registration, management, maintenance, and disposal of the respective storage types.</li>
<li>Throughout this policy, sensitive information pertains to data classified as RESTRICTED or CONFIDENTIAL as per the Data Classification Policy (reference (a)).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Policy</h2>
<ul>
<li>Removable Media Policy</li>
</ul>
<li>All active-use removable media containing organizational data must be registered within the organization's Asset Inventory (reference (b)).</li>
<li>Quarterly re-inventorying of all removable media listed in reference (b) is mandatory to confirm its continued organization control. The re-inventory process entails the owner of the removable media checking in the item with the organization's Information Security Manager (ISM).</li>
<li>Removable media that cannot be located should be treated as lost by the ISM, necessitating logging of a security incident report in accordance with the Security Incident Response Policy (reference (c)).</li>
<li>The owner of removable media is responsible for periodic maintenance, such as cleaning, formatting, labeling, etc., tailored to the media type. Where feasible, an alternate or backup copy of the stored information on removable media must be maintained by its owner.</li>
<li>Secure storage of removable media in locations with minimal fire or flood risk is required.</li>
<li>If sensitive information is stored, the following must be adhered to:</li>
<ul>
<li>Locked storage in a cabinet or drawer.</li>
<li>Storage of exclusively encrypted data in accordance with the Encryption Policy (reference (d)).</li>
<li>Data on removable media must be erased or the device destroyed before reuse or disposal.</li>
<li>The device owner must notify the ISM when a removable media device is disposed of, ensuring its removal from reference (b).</li>
<li>Cloud Storage Policy</li>
</ul>

<p>All active-use cloud storage systems containing organizational data must be registered in reference (b). Manual or automated means can be used for registration.</p>
<ul>
<li>Quarterly re-inventorying of all cloud storage systems listed in reference (b) is required to verify continued organizational control. Similar to removable media, re-inventorying necessitates the system owner checking in the item with the ISM.</li>
<li>The cloud storage system owner is responsible for regular maintenance, encompassing system configuration, access control, performance monitoring, etc.</li>
<li>Data on cloud storage systems must be replicated to at least one other physical location, subject to automatic configuration depending on the cloud storage provider.</li>
<li>The organization must exclusively employ cloud storage providers demonstrating secure physical and electronic facilities through accreditations, demonstrations, tours, or other means.</li>
<li>If sensitive information is stored, encryption in accordance with reference (d) is mandatory.</li>
<li>Erasure of data from cloud storage systems must adhere to an ISM-approved technology and process.</li>
<li>Upon discontinuation of a cloud storage system's use, the system owner must inform the ISM for its removal from reference (b).</li>
<li>Personally-Owned Devices Policy</li>
<li>Organizational data stored, transferred, or processed on personally-owned devices remains the property of the organization. The organization retains authority over such data despite not owning the device.</li>
<li>The ISM is responsible for overall management of personally-owned devices, encompassing:</li>
<li>Installation and maintenance of Mobile Device Management (MDM) software to control and wipe organization-controlled data.</li>
<li>Maintenance of a list of authorized persons, applications, and databases accessible from personally-owned devices.</li>
<li>Maintenance of a list of prohibited applications on personally-owned devices, and informing users of restrictions.</li>
<li>Personally-identifiable information (PII) may not be stored, processed, or accessed on personally-owned devices.</li>
<li>Users of personally-owned devices must observe acceptable use requirements, including data backup, MDM and endpoint protection software installation, encryption of sensitive data, device security mechanisms, and adherence to wireless network security.</li>
<li>Personally-owned devices must not be left unattended when outside the organization's premises and should be physically secured if possible.</li>
<li>Data security measures must be taken in public areas to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
<li>Regular installation of patches and updates is required.</li>
<li>Classified information must be protected as per reference (a).</li>
<li>The ISM must be notified before disposing, selling, or transferring a personally-owned device.</li>
<li>Prohibited actions include granting device access to non-owners, storing illegal content, using unlicensed software, locally storing passwords, transferring data to unapproved devices, and unauthorized data deletion.</li>
<li>The organization retains the right to access, edit, or delete organizational information on the device, including full data deletion for protection purposes without the owner's consent.</li>
<li>Compensation for device usage or new software installation rests with the organization.</li>
<li>All security breaches involving personally-owned devices must be promptly reported to the ISM.</li>
</ul>
