<h2>Purpose and Scope</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The purpose of this policy is to establish clear objectives and requirements for the retention of data within the organization, irrespective of its medium (electronic, paper, etc.).</li>
    <li>This policy encompasses all data under the organization's custody or control, referred to as information within this context.</li>
    <li>It applies to all users of the organization's information systems, including employees, contractors, and external parties interacting with the organization's information.</li>
    <li>The policy's availability must be ensured for all users.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Background</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The organization is subject to various legal, regulatory, and contractual obligations regarding data retention and destruction. These obligations dictate the duration for which data must be retained and the appropriate procedures for data destruction. Such obligations encompass local jurisdiction laws, regulations, contracts with employees, customers, service providers, partners, and other stakeholders.</li>
    <li>Additionally, the organization may encounter scenarios such as litigation or disaster recovery that necessitate access to original information for safeguarding the interests of the organization, its employees, customers, service providers, partners, and others.</li>
    <li>Consequently, the organization may be required to archive and retain information beyond its day-to-day operational needs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Policy</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Information Retention</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Retention pertains to maintaining information in a production or live environment accessible to authorized users during regular business operations.</li>
    <li>Information employed in system development, staging, and testing shall not be retained beyond their active usage period or copied into production or live environments.</li>
    <li>The default retention period for information is an active usage period of precisely two years from its creation, unless an exception for a longer or shorter retention period is granted.</li>
    <li>The requesting business unit must seek an exception.</li>
    <li>Post the active usage period as per this policy and approved exceptions, information must be archived for a defined duration.</li>
    <li>Once the designated archive period concludes, the information must be securely destroyed.</li>
    <li>Each business unit is accountable for the creation, usage, storage, processing, and destruction of the information in alignment with this policy.</li>
    <li>The business unit responsible for the information is considered the information owner.</li>
    <li>In response to potential or actual litigation, arbitration, claims, disputes, or regulatory actions, the organization's legal counsel may issue a litigation hold requiring the retention of pertinent information, following legal counsel's instructions.</li>
    <li>Upon separation or retirement, each employee and contractor affiliated with the company must return information in their possession or control to the organization.</li>
    <li>Information owners are responsible for enforcing retention, archiving, and destruction protocols and must communicate these periods to relevant parties.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Information Archiving</li>
<ul>
    <li>Archiving refers to the secure storage of information, rendering it inaccessible to ordinary authorized users while enabling retrieval by an administrator appointed by company management.</li>
    <li>Physical records (e.g., paper) must be archived in secure storage (onsite or offsite) and clearly labeled in archive boxes, identifying the information owner.</li>
    <li>Electronic records must be archived with robust access controls set by the information owner, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility.</li>
    <li>The default archiving period for information is 7 years, subject to approved exceptions for longer or shorter durations, sought by the information owner.</li>
    <li>An archiving period beyond 7 years may be considered for information of vital historical significance, such as corporate records, contracts, and technical/trade secrets.</li>
    <li>An archiving period shorter than 7 years may be warranted for information with limited business purpose, e.g., emails, travel itineraries, pre-trip advisories, or to comply with specific legal, contractual, and regulatory mandates (e.g., PCI DSS, GDPR, etc.).</li>
    <li>Information must be destructed (as defined below) at the conclusion of the elapsed archiving period.</li>
</ul>
    <li>Information Destruction</li>
<ul>
    <li>Destruction denotes rendering information irretrievable by ordinary commercially-available means through physical or technical means.</li>
    <li>The organization must maintain and enforce a comprehensive list of approved destruction methods suitable for each type of archived information, spanning physical storage media like CD-ROMs, DVDs, backup tapes, hard drives, mobile devices, portable drives, database records, or backup files.</li>
    <li>Physical information in paper form must be shredded using authorized shredding equipment, with waste periodically removed by approved personnel.</li>
    <li>Retention and archiving periods for information created, processed, stored, and used by the organization are outlined in Appendix A: "Retention Periods."</li>
