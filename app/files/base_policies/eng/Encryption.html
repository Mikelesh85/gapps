<title>Policy Document</title>

<h2>Purpose and Scope</h2>
<ul>
<li>This policy establishes the organizational requisites for the implementation of cryptographic controls and cryptographic keys to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and nonrepudiation of information.</li>
<li>The policy is applicable to all systems, equipment, facilities, and information within the organization's information security program.</li>
<li>Compliance with this policy is mandatory for all employees, contractors, temporary workers, service providers, and individuals engaged by external entities to work on cryptographic systems, algorithms, or keying material for the organization.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Background</h2>
<ul>
<li>This policy outlines the overarching goals and operational guidelines for the utilization of cryptographic algorithms and keys within the organization.</li>
<li>A standardized approach to cryptographic controls is imperative across all operational units to establish end-to-end security and facilitate interoperability.</li>
<li>This document delineates approved algorithms, requirements for effective key management and safeguarding, and guidelines for cryptographic application within cloud environments.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Policy</h2>
<ul>
<li>The organization shall safeguard individual systems and information through the deployment of cryptographic controls, as specified in Table 3:</li>

<li>Unless otherwise stipulated, owners shall manage cryptographic keys associated with their systems.</li>
<li>Cryptographic keys must be shielded from loss, unauthorized alteration, or destruction by implementing suitable access control mechanisms.</li>
<li>Regular key backups must be conducted to ensure resilience.</li>
<li>In instances necessitating it, customers of the organization's cloud-based software or platform shall be provided with information regarding:</li>
<ul>
<li>Utilized cryptographic tools for information protection.</li>
<li>Feasible capabilities enabling cloud service customers to apply their cryptographic solutions.</li>
<li>Geographical locations where cryptographic tools are deployed for storing or transmitting cloud service customer data.</li>
<li>The deployment of organizationally-approved encryption must adhere to the legal regulations of the country, region, or governing body in which users operate.</li>
<li>Encryption shall not be employed to breach any laws or regulations, including import/export restrictions.</li>
<li>The encryption methodologies employed by the organization adhere to international standards and U.S. import/export mandates, ensuring cross-border usage for legitimate business purposes.</li>
<li>All key management activities shall be conducted using software that automates access control, secure storage, key rotation, and backup.</li>
<li>Specifically:</li>
</ul>
<li>The key management service shall grant specific users access to keys, enabling encryption/decryption and data encryption key generation.</li>
<li>The key management service shall bestow key administration privileges upon designated users, allowing key creation, scheduling, deletion, rotation enablement/disablement, and usage policy configuration.</li>
<li>The key management service shall securely store and backup keys throughout their operational lifecycle.</li>
<li>Key rotation within the key management service shall occur at least once every 12 months.</li>
