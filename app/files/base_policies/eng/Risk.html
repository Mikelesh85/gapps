<h2>Purpose and Scope</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The purpose of this policy is to establish a standardized approach for the identification, assessment, and treatment of information security risks within the organization.</li>
    <li>It further outlines an acceptable level of risk determined by the organization's leadership.</li>
    <li>The principles of risk assessment and risk treatment extend across the entire spectrum of the organization's information security program, encompassing all assets used or associated with the organization that may impact its information security.</li>
    <li>This policy applies to all employees participating in risk assessment and risk treatment activities within the organization.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Background</h2>
<ul>
    <li>An integral part of the organization's comprehensive information security program is a systematic and comprehensive risk management methodology.</li>
    <li>This policy outlines the conditions and procedures for identifying security risks to information.</li>
    <li>This structured process includes four fundamental phases: identifying assets, along with relevant threats and vulnerabilities; assessing the likelihood and impact (risk) arising from these threats and vulnerabilities; formulating treatment strategies to address unacceptable risks; and assessing residual risk after treatment.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Risk Assessment</li>
</ul>
<ul>
        <li>The risk assessment process involves identifying threats and vulnerabilities related to company assets. Initiating risk assessment involves recognizing all assets within the scope of the information security programâ€”specifically, assets with potential implications for information confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability.</li>
        <li>Such assets encompass various forms, including electronic and paper documents, applications, databases, IT equipment, infrastructure components, and services/processes for external affairs. An asset owner must be designated for each asset.</li>
        <li>Consequently, all threats and vulnerabilities associated with each asset must be specified.</li>
        <li>A comprehensive risk assessment table will cover these threats and vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li>It is acknowledged that one asset may be associated with multiple threats, and each threat may correspond to numerous vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li>The Risk Assessment Report Template (reference [a]) includes an example risk assessment table.</li>
        <li>A responsible owner must be identified for each risk.</li>
        <li>It is permissible for the risk owner and the asset owner to be the same person.</li>
        <li>Subsequently, risk owners are tasked with assessing:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
            <li>The consequences of each pairing of threats and vulnerabilities for individual assets, in the event the risk materializes.</li>
            <li>The likelihood of the risk occurring (i.e., the probability that a threat will exploit the vulnerability of the respective asset).</li>
</ul>

    <li>Criteria for measuring consequences and likelihood are shown in Tables 3 and 4.</li>
    <li>The calculation of risk level involves aggregating consequence and likelihood results.</li>

<ul>
<li>Risk Acceptance Criteria</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Risk levels from 0 to 2 are considered acceptable.</li>
    <li>Risk levels of 3 and 4 are considered unacceptable and require risk treatment.</li>
</ul>
<li>Risk Treatment</li>
<ul>
    <li>Risk treatment is carried out through the Risk Treatment Table, where all risks documented in the Risk Assessment Table are replicated along with treatment options and residual risk.</li>
    <li>The Risk Treatment Report Template (reference [a]) provides an illustrative Risk Treatment Table.</li>
    <li>During risk treatment, the CEO and/or company managers define objectives for mitigating or addressing risks.</li>
    <li>All unacceptable risks must undergo treatment.</li>
    <li>In the interest of continuous improvement, company managers may also decide to address risks for company assets, even if their risk result is considered acceptable.</li>
    <li>Treatment methods include:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
        <li>Selection or formulation of security controls.</li>
        <li>Transferring risk to a third party, which may involve obtaining insurance or making contracts with suppliers or partners.</li>
        <li>Avoiding risk by discontinuing business activities that pose such risks.</li>
        <li>Risk acceptance; however, this approach is allowed only when the costs of alternative risk treatment options exceed the potential impact of the risk.</li>
        <li>After selecting a treatment option, the risk owner should anticipate changed consequences and likelihood values after implementing planned controls.</li>
    </ul>
