<h2>Purpose and Scope</h2>
<ul>
<li>The purpose of this application security policy is to establish a comprehensive framework of security measures and obligations for applications, with a focus on web applications, within the organization's production environment.</li>
<li>This policy outlines the implementation of controls and directives for ensuring web application security, including regular vulnerability assessments, evaluations, and appraisals.</li>
<li>The policy extends its reach to encompass all applications within the organization's production environment, as well as administrators and users of these applications, which includes employees and contractors.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Background</h2>
<ul>
<li>Application vulnerabilities serve as prominent initial attack vectors subsequent to malware infections. It is therefore imperative that security is an inherent part of application design, and that continuous monitoring and scanning are conducted to detect potential malicious activities indicative of system compromise.</li>
<li>Identifying and mitigating application vulnerabilities not only reduces the organization's attack surface but also establishes a fundamental level of security across all systems.</li>
<li>Additionally, this policy defines technical prerequisites and procedures to ensure that applications are fortified in line with security best practices.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Policy</h2>
<ul>
<li>Secure Application Development and Management</li>
</ul>
<li>The organization must ensure that all developed and/or acquired applications are configured and managed with security as a paramount concern.</li>
<ul>
<li>Security Best Practices</li>
</ul>
<li>Classification of managed data according to the Data Classification Policy (reference: Data Classification Policy).</li>
<li>Display of a conspicuous confidential record banner for applications handling confidential information, highlighting the type of accessed confidential data (e.g., personally identifiable information (PII), protected health information (PHI), etc.).</li>
<li>Non-display of sensitive data, especially information restricted by law or policy, in plaintext.</li>
<li>Rigorous validation of input to accept only known correct input types, including but not limited to cross-site scripting, buffer overflow errors, and injection flaws.</li>
<li>Proper error handling to prevent detailed system information exposure, service denial, security mechanism impairment, or system crashes.</li>
<li>Authorization based on affiliation, membership, or employment rather than individual authorization, where possible. Automated periodic authorization reviews should be conducted, if feasible.</li>
<li>Encryption of data at rest and in transit.</li>
<li>Implementation of application logging to the extent of feasibility, retaining logs of user and access events for at least 14 days.</li>

<li>Security Review and Change Management</li>
<ul>
<li>Qualified peers must conduct security reviews of code for all new or significantly modified applications that involve the collection, use, and/or display of confidential data. Comprehensive documentation of actions taken is mandatory.</li>
<li>A change management process for existing software application modifications must be implemented.</li>
<li>Documentation of the standard application configuration is mandatory.</li>
<li>Immediate change of default passwords used within the application, such as those for administrative control panels or database integration, upon installation.</li>
<li>Application password complexity in accordance with prevailing security best practices (minimum 8 characters in length, a combination of alphanumeric upper/lowercase characters, and symbols) is mandated.</li>
</ul>
<li>Data Handling and Testing</li>
<ul>
<li>During development and testing phases, applications must not access live data.</li>
</ul>
<li>Acquired Applications</li>
<ul>
<li>Only applications supported by approved vendors shall be procured and deployed.</li>
<li>Full life-cycle support contracts must be arranged with application vendors.</li>
<li>Vendor-issued updates, patches, and configuration changes should be promptly implemented.</li>
</ul>
<li>Web Application Assessment Criteria</li>
<ul>
<li>New or major application releases must undergo a comprehensive assessment before approval for deployment into the production environment.</li>
<li>Third-party or acquired applications must undergo a thorough assessment before deployment.</li>
<li>Software releases must undergo appropriate assessments, determined by the organization's information security manager, based on inherent security risks.</li>
<li>Emergency releases may bypass security assessments, subject to Chief Information Officer or designee approval.</li>
</ul>
<li>Vulnerability Mitigation</li>
<ul>
<li>Application vulnerabilities discovered during assessments must be mitigated based on risk levels.</li>
<li>Vulnerabilities categorized as high risk must be immediately fixed or alternately mitigated to limit exposure before deployment.</li>
<li>Vulnerabilities categorized as medium or low risk must undergo mitigation scheduling.</li>
<li>Fixes and mitigation strategies for medium risk or greater vulnerabilities must be validated through testing.</li>
</ul>
<li>Security Assessment Types</li>
<ul>
<li>Assessments may leverage Full, Quick, or Targeted security assessment types, each serving specific purposes.</li>
</ul>
<li>Data Center Security</li>
<ul>
<li>A Data Center Security Policy (reference: Data Center Security Policy) counters unauthorized access risks.</li>
</ul>
<li>Software Development Life Cycle</li>
<ul>
<li>The Software Development Lifecycle Policy (reference: Software Development Lifecycle Policy) outlines security requirements for software development, acquisition, and maintenance.</li>
</ul>
<li>Incident Response</li>
<ul>
<li>Security requirements for handling information security incidents are defined in the Security Incident Response Policy (reference: Security Incident Response Policy).</li>
</ul>
<li>Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity</li>
<ul>
<li>The Disaster Recovery Policy (reference: Disaster Recovery Policy) encompasses disaster recovery and business continuity management.</li>
</ul>
<li>System Availability</li>
<ul>
<li>System Availability Policy (reference: System Availability Policy) delineates information system availability and redundancy requisites.</li>
</ul>
