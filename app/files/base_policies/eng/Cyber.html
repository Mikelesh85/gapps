<h2>Purpose and Scope</h2>
<ul>
<li>The purpose of this policy is to establish a comprehensive framework for assessing and mitigating information security risks within the organization while defining an acceptable overall risk level.</li>
<li>Risk assessment and risk treatment encompass the entirety of the organization's information security program and all relevant information systems that impact the organization's security.</li>
<li>This policy applies to all management and employees participating in the organization's risk assessment activities and is accessible to all affected parties.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Background</h2>
<ul>
<li>This policy outlines a systematic approach to conducting risk assessments and addressing identified risks from an information security standpoint. It also details the creation of the Risk Assessment Report, a crucial component of the risk assessment process.</li>
<li>During risk assessments, the organization must identify all organizational information systems, along with associated threats and vulnerabilities, and assess their severity using a predefined rating scale.</li>
<li>Asset and risk owners must be assigned for each risk item. Following the assessment, risk treatment strategies are devised to manage risks, especially when overall assessed risk ratings are deemed too high.</li>
<li>Risk treatment options include implementing security controls, outsourcing risk, accepting risk, or discontinuing risk-associated activities. Third-party penetration testing is conducted to validate the accuracy of risk assessments and the effectiveness of implemented risk treatments.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Procedure for Executing Risk Assessment Report</h2>
<ul>
<li>The execution of the Risk Assessment Report involves the following steps, in accordance with the Risk Assessment Policy:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Verification that the entire risk assessment and risk treatment process aligns with the Risk Assessment Policy.</li>
<li>The risk assessment aimed to identify vulnerabilities, threats, and their potential exploitation, evaluating their criticality.</li>
<li>Risk treatment strategies were developed to systematically reduce or control identified risks.</li>
<li>All risk assessment and treatment activities were conducted within the organization's information security program scope.</li>
<li>The risk assessment occurred from [day/month/year] to [day/month/year], while risk treatment occurred from [day/month/year] to [day/month/year]. Final reports were produced during [specify period].</li>
<li>[Person responsible for managing the risk assessment process] oversaw the risk assessment and risk treatment process, with assistance from [person or company responsible for assistance].</li>
<li>Data was collected through questionnaires and interviews with asset owners across organizational units.</li>
<li>The process unfolded as follows:</li>
</ul>

<li>Identification of all information systems and their owners.</li>
<li>Identification of threats and corresponding vulnerabilities for each asset.</li>
<li>Assignment of risk owners for each identified risk.</li>
<li>Evaluation of consequences (confidentiality, integrity, availability) on a scale of 0 to 2, and likelihood of risk occurrence on the same scale.</li>
<li>Calculation of risk level by combining consequence and likelihood scores.</li>
<li>Identification of unacceptable risks with scores of 3 or 4.</li>
<li>Consideration of risk treatment options and selection of appropriate information security controls for each unacceptable risk.</li>
<li>Assessment of residual risks after control implementation.</li>
<li>Key documents utilized or generated during the risk assessment and risk treatment include:</li>
<ul>
<li>Risk Assessment Table (Appendix A): Displays values for consequence and likelihood for system-vulnerability-threat combinations and calculates risk scores.</li>
<li>Risk Treatment Table (Appendix B): Defines risk treatment options, control selection for unacceptable risks, and residual risk levels.</li>
</ul>
