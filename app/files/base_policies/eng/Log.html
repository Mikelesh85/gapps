<h2>Purpose and Scope</h2>
<ul>
<li>The purpose of this log management and review policy is to establish specific requirements for information systems to effectively generate, store, process, and consolidate pertinent audit logs across the entire organizational environment.</li>
<li>These logs serve as crucial resources for obtaining key insights and detecting potential indicators of compromise.</li>
<li>This policy is applicable to all information systems operating within the organization's production network.</li>
<li>Furthermore, this policy extends to all employees, contractors, and partners of the organization who administer or provide maintenance for production systems.</li>
<li>Throughout this policy, these individuals will be referred to as system administrators.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Background</h2>
<ul>
<li>Evaluating an information system's security level in terms of confidentiality, integrity, and availability necessitates the accumulation of audit data that offers valuable insights into system activities and performance.</li>
<li>This audit data is effectively captured through system logs.</li>
<li>Logging activities of critical systems, applications, and services provides essential information for metrics and incident investigations.</li>
<li>This policy lays out specific mandates and guidelines for managing such logs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Policy</h2>
<ul>
<li>Every production system within the organization is required to record and retain audit logging information encompassing the following details:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Activities conducted on the system.</li>
<li>The user or entity (e.g., system account) responsible for the activity, including the source system where the activity originated.</li>
<li>The file, application, or object that was the subject of the activity.</li>
<li>The timestamp of the activity.</li>
<li>The tool employed to carry out the activity.</li>
</ul>
<li>The outcome of the activity (e.g., success or failure). Specific activities to be logged must encompass, at minimum:</li>
<ul>
<li>Creation, reading, updating, or deletion of information (including authentication details such as usernames or passwords).</li>
<li>Initiated or accepted network connections.</li>
<li>User authentication and authorization for systems and networks.</li>
<li>Changes to access rights, including the addition of new users or groups, alterations to user privileges, file permissions, database object permissions, firewall rules, and passwords.</li>
<li>Modifications to system, network, or service configurations, encompassing software installations, patches, updates, and other software changes.</li>
<li>Commencement, cessation, or restart of an application.</li>
<li>Abnormal termination, failure, or premature termination of an application process, particularly due to resource depletion or reaching resource limits/thresholds (e.g., CPU, memory, network connections, bandwidth, disk space, etc.), network service failures (e.g., DHCP, DNS), or hardware malfunctions.</li>
<li>Detection of suspicious and/or malicious activities by security systems such as Intrusion Detection or Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS), anti-virus systems, or anti-spyware systems. Unless technically infeasible or impractical, all logs must be consolidated within a centralized system to enable correlation, analysis, and tracking of activities across diverse systems, thereby facilitating identification of patterns, trends, and cascading effects.</li>
<li>Log aggregation systems are required to possess automatic, timely log ingestion, event and anomaly labeling, alerting capabilities, and manual review capabilities. Regular manual review of logs is mandatory:</li>
</ul>
<li>User, administrator, and system operator activities must undergo monthly reviews.</li>
<li>Logs containing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) must be scrutinized at least monthly to identify anomalous behavior. When utilizing an outsourced cloud environment, logs must encompass access and usage of cloud environments, resource allocation, PII changes, and activities of all administrators and operators. Logs should be retained for cloud environment activities.</li>
<li>All information systems within the organization must synchronize their clocks utilizing Network Time Protocol (NTP) or a similar mechanism. It is mandatory for all information systems to synchronize with a common primary time source.</li>
